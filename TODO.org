** TODO Other operating systems                                    :feature:

The .net helper app probably won't work anywhere else since it's framework.  Maybe windows could use powershell,
and I can find something else for linux and macOS?

** TODO Capture background color

Pasting text from modes other than org doesn't include the background color, so if the output is going to an
application or text area with a light background my color scheme becomes an issue.

** DONE Org output has xml declaration at the top                       :bug:

Seems that `org-html-export-as-html' is generating more than just an html fragment.

This should export the org syntax as html, rather than encoding the org markup with syntax highlighting as html.
Maybe it could be an option or a setting to do either/or?
