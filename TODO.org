** TODO Special org-mode handling

This should export the org syntax as html, rather than encoding the org markup with syntax highlighting as html.
Maybe it could be an option or a setting to do either/or?

** TODO Other operating systems

The .net helper app probably won't work anywhere else since it's framework.  Maybe windows could use powershell,
and I can find something else for linux and macOS?
